# 🪔 Diwali Sales Analysis | Customer Segmentation & Demand Insights

A data analytics project focused on understanding **customer purchasing behavior during Diwali sales** to help businesses identify revenue-driving demographics, prevent stock imbalances, and make data-driven marketing and inventory decisions.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

During Diwali sales, businesses handle large volumes of transactions but often lack clarity on **who is driving revenue** and **which product categories face stock-out or overstocking risks**.

In this project, I analyzed Diwali sales data to move the team from assumptions to insights. By cleaning data in **Excel** and performing analysis using **Python on Google Colab**, I identified high-spending customer segments, demand patterns, and product categories requiring better inventory planning.

## 🎯 Business Problem

The business team faced multiple challenges:

* Difficulty identifying **specific customer demographics driving the majority of revenue**
* Unexpected **stock-outs in high-demand categories** and **overstocking in low-demand ones**
* Inefficient ad spend due to lack of targeted customer insights
* Limited visibility into customer purchasing behavior during peak festive demand

Without segmentation and predictive insights, decisions around marketing and inventory were reactive rather than strategic.

## 🎯 Goal of the Analysis

To build a data-driven analysis that:

* Identifies **highest spending customer segments**
* Understands purchasing behavior across demographics and product categories
* Highlights areas requiring improved inventory planning
* Supports optimized ad spend through better customer targeting
* Enables demand prediction to reduce stock-related losses
